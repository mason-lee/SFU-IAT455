## Lecture -1
_Sep 4th_.

### Goals for Today

* Introductions 
* Course Overview
..* Outline - objectives
..* Resources
..* Expectations and Grading
* What is computational media?
* Visual systems: Characteristics and Limitations

### What Matt is expecting students to know.
* Image carousel for the website with visual effects
* Simple mixin program
* Talk about digital media

### Sample Projects from Past Sessions
* Skin segmentations...
* Gaussian blur..
* Face detection
* Recognizing the picture and retrieve similar picture from database
* etc...

### Course Materials
* Textbook - probably somewhere online...
* Research papers

#### Demo of first workshop


### About pulling code from somewhere
When you steal the code from stackoverflow, include the share link of the answer at least!

### Going through the lecture notes
* Digital Compositing
..* We are gonna actually look at the math and principles of compositing.
..* The process of integraitng images from multiple sources into a single, seamless whole.

Render pipeline.
..* Several layers in one frame time.
..* Layering images on top of each other.

* Foundations of Digital Compositing
..* Walt Disney's MultiPlane Camera
..* Some examples from Youtube about parallax scrolling

* Matte
..* it is basically where the *peach is and where it isn't

* Visual Systems
* Simultaneous Contrast
* Light bounces around in our world infinitely(almost), representing all those bounces in computer is very expensive
..* Look at the [path tracing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_tracing) and [lay tracing..?]

* Diffuses
* Diffracts - how the light bounces off
* Refraction - When a person is in the body, the water density is different from the air so the light refracts....
* Shadows: Clue for the Source of Light
..* Size of shadow
..* Density
..* Softness
*The Camera
..* **Depth of Field: the range of distance
..* Depth of Field != Depth of focus
